	* Further notes on how to use this class:
	*
	* -Setters- Online limitations.
	* Setting several of these values will not automatically relay this information over the network.
	* This will result in desync of these value across online player's games, or your changes being immediatly
	* reverted by the data coming in from these other online players.
	*
	* If the ChrIns you are modifying is a player, most data fields will be immediatly reverted by incoming data
	* from their online games. If the ChrIns is not a player, the data may or may not be relayed automatically
	* or may or may not be overwritten by incoming data depending on the field, if you are the host of the online
	* session.
	*
	* Use this api's network utilites in your scripts to ensure intended behaivor and utilize possible work arounds.
	*
	* Read the documentation of each method for more information, each setter method should document a basic description
	* of the unpatched network behaivor when modifying said field.
