If you would like to collaborate to the development of HoodiePatcher join my discord server and ping me, then we can chat about it. I am NamelessHoodie.

Currently, it's functions are rather limited.

Difficulty Module:
This allows difficulty settings for dark souls 3 based on preset(hardcoded) templates and user set multipliers in the config.

DebugAnimSpeed Enabler:
Pretty simple, it enables the homonymous TAE event.

HkObjects limit extender:
This is also pretty self explanatory, it extends the behbnd Hkobject limit in behbnd.
